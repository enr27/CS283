1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client determines when a command's output is fully received when it reveives an EOF character from the server. To handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission, the remote client loops recv() until the EOF is detected. 

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

A network shell can define and detect the beginning and end of a command by checking if each command is null-terminated. If it's not handled correctly, commands could be merged incorrectly or cause incompelete execution. 

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

Stateful protocols keep track of information from previous interactions, while stateless protocals treat each request independently and do not retain information from previous interactions. 

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

Because it still offers faster data transmission compared to TCP, which makes it more ideal for applications where real-time data transmission is prioritized.

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

The operating system provides sockets API to enable applications to use network communications.
